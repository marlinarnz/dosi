Hi Simon,

This is really brilliant, thank you again. We=E2=80=99ve now been =
through, checked and edited all the data series and logfits, and used =
this to re-run all the analysis we did in the original RITE report. =
(Still no more exciting results, but a method & dataset that=E2=80=99s =
robust and shareable publicly now).
=20
There are possibly 2-3 specific extra logfits we may need, but we=E2=80=99=
re discussing tomorrow. Will let you know.

On your points, all make good sense. There=E2=80=99s just one needs =
action.

> Most of the rows in the summary table that you both added information =
to, have been merged into the summary table of v25. There is a separate =
file indicating which ones were not matched. Many of those are "Partial =
up to max" or "Cumulative" series for which the base series had changed =
indicator name/number (e.g. 1.1 to 3.2). Instead of fixing this, I let =
it be as all but 7 of the unmatched rows were marked for deletion. Can =
you have a look at the 7 rows that are in the =
sumary_table_..._not_matched_v25.csv file that were not marked for =
deletion and let me know whether they should be included in the new =
file, please?
Of the 7 rows, 5 are time series we do need  - they=E2=80=99re all new =
market share time series which weren=E2=80=99t in the original _v24, =
hence they had no match.

For these 5 I also couldn=E2=80=99t find logfit graphs in the _v25_ALL =
file. Would be v helpful to include these so we can visually inspect the =
fits.

For now, I just manually copied these 5 time series from the =E2=80=9Cnot =
matched_v25=E2=80=9D file across into the _v25 analysis file I=E2=80=99m =
working with as a temp fix. The five are highlighted in green in the =
attached, and also summarised here:

dri_usa_3.2Adc_d334_m185 ** should be 1.1Ado + missing log fit graph
dri_was_3.2Adc_d334_m185 ** should be 1.1Ado + missing log fit graph
pas_aus_1.1Ado_d339_m185 ** missing log fit graph
pas_bel_1.1Ado_d339_m185 ** missing log fit graph
pas_ger_1.1Ado_d339_m185 ** missing log fit graph
=EF=BF=BC

Thanks,
Charlie

> For the market shares, where the unconstrained logistic fit returned =
an asymptote greater than 1, I repeated a fit with a constraint. This =
seems to have worked - asymptotes are less than or equal to 1 (with a =
numerical fitting algorithm that however does not guarantee a globally =
optimal solution)
> I made some changes in the metadata labeling file that Charlie edited =
and marked them with color: metadata_master_v23_CWedit_SDS20250404.xlsx
> I added a few comments in the Word document To Dos after RITE 28Feb =
submission.docx
> I created a separate pdf with only those series that were not marked =
for deletion in the summary table.
> I used the original file with denominator data for market shares =
because the more recent one did not have new data, it seemed to me - and =
I had made corrections to the original file for smooth merging that =
would have needed to be repeated.
> Please let me know what you think, and whether other changes should be =
made to this version.
